# CME 211 Lecture 2: Conditionals, Lists, Loops, and File IO

## Reading

Relevant chapters in *Learning Python* by Mark Lutz are:

* Chapter 4 (Introducing Python Object Types) has a summary of the object types
* Chapter 5: Numeric Types
* Chapter 7: String Fundamentals
* Chapter 8: Lists and Dictionaries (you can ignore Dictionaries for now)
* Chapter 9: Tuples, Files, and Everything Else
* Chapter 11: Assignments, Expressions, and Prints
* Chapter 12: `if` Tests and Syntax Rules
* Chapter 13: `while` and `for` Loops

## Outline

We have a lot to cover in this lecture:

* Python data types
* Logical Operations
* `if` statements
* Python lists
* Looping
* File input output

## Big picture

To complete a task in any programming language, the software developer must
consider the following:

* Data and it's representation
* Operations: modifying or computing things from data
* Flow of control: selecting which operations to run

With the combination of these things, we can write programs that tell a computer
what to do.  A computer program is a form of imperative or procedural knowledge.
Most programming today is done in this style.  This is different from
declarative knowledge.  An example of this difference from mathematics is a
system of equations vs. an algorithm to find a solution to the system of
equations.  The algorithm tells a specific procedure so that we can find the
quantity we are interested in.
