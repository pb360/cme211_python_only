    "## Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevant chapters in *Learning Python* by Mark Lutz are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Chapter 4 (Introducing Python Object Types) has a summary of the object types\n",
    "* Chapter 5: Numeric Types\n",
    "* Chapter 7: String Fundamentals\n",
    "* Chapter 8: Lists and Dictionaries (you can ignore Dictionaries for now)\n",
    "* Chapter 9: Tuples, Files, and Everything Else\n",
    "* Chapter 11: Assignments, Expressions, and Prints\n",
    "* Chapter 12: `if` Tests and Syntax Rules\n",
    "* Chapter 13: `while` and `for` Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a lot to cover in this lecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python data types\n",
    "* Logical Operations\n",
    "* `if` statements\n",
    "* Python lists\n",
    "* Looping\n",
    "* File input output\n",

    "## Big picture\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete a task in any programming language, the software developer must\n",
    "consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data and it's representation\n",
    "* Operations: modifying or computing things from data\n",
    "* Flow of control: selecting which operations to run\n",
    "\n",
    "With the combination of these things, we can write programs that tell a computer\n",
    "what to do.  A computer program is a form of imperative or procedural knowledge.\n",
    "Most programming today is done in this style.  This is different from\n",
    "declarative knowledge.  An example of this difference from mathematics is a\n",
    "system of equations vs. an algorithm to find a solution to the system of\n",
    "equations.  The algorithm tells a specific procedure so that we can find the\n",
    "quantity we are interested in."
