# CME 211: Lecture 4: Functions and Complexity Analysis

## Python functions

* Code we have seen so far has been executed in linear fashion from top to
  bottom, sometimes repeating one or more lines in a loop body

* Functions allow us to:

  * Replace duplicated code with one centralized implementation within a single
    program

  * Reuse code across different programs

  * Easily use code developed by others

  * Develop, test, debug code in isolation from other code

* Analogous to mathematical functions

## Defining a function in Python

Let's start with an example:

```python
def print_hello(name):
    print("Hello, {}".format(name))
```

If Python encounters a function name without parens `()`, it tells us that it
is a function:

```python
print_hello
```

Call the function:

```python
print_hello("CME211")
```

## Anatomy of a Python function

```python
def function_name(input_argument):
    # function body
    print("you guys rock")
```

1. start with `def` keyword

2. give the function name

3. followed by comma separated list of input arguments, surrounded by
   parentheses

  * just use `()` for no input arguments

4. followed by a colon `:`

5. followed by **indented** function body

### Return a value

Use the `return` keyword to return an object from a function:

```python
def summation(a, b):
    total = 0
    for n in range(a,b+1):
        total += n
    return total
```

```python
c = summation(1, 100)
c
```

### Return multiple values

Separate multiple return values with a comma:

```python
def sum_and_prod(a,b):
   total = 0
   prod = 1
   for n in range(a,b+1):
       total += n
       prod *= n
   return total, prod
```

Call the function:

```python
a = sum_and_prod(1,10)
print("a:", a)
print("type(a):", type(a))
```

The `return` keyword packs multiple outputs into a tuple.  You can use Python's
tuple unpacking to nicely get the return values in calling code.

```python
a, b = sum_and_prod(1,10)
print("a:", a)
print("b:", b)
```

## Variable scope

Let's look at an example to start discussing variable scope:

```python
total = 42
def summation(a, b):
    total = 0
    for n in range(a, b+1):
        total += n
    return total

a = summation(1, 100)
a
```

```python
print("total:", total)
```

```python
print("n:", n)
```

Function bodies have a local namespace.  In this example the `summation`
function does not see the variable `total` from the top level scope.
`summation` creates its own variable `total` which is different!  The top level
scope also cannot see variables used inside of `summation`.

Reference before assignment to a global scope variable will cause an error:

```python
total = 0
def summation(a, b):
    for n in range(a, b+1):
        total = total + n
        #         ^
        #       reference before assignment
    return total

a = summation(1, 100)
```

### Variable scope examples

It is possible to use a variable from a higher scope.  This is generally
considered bad practice:

```python
a = ['hi', 'bye']
def func():
    print(a)

func()
```

Even worse practice is modifying a mutable object from a higher scope:

```python
a = ['hi', 'bye']
def func():
    a.append('hello')

func()
print(a)
```

Python will not let you redirect an identifier at a global scope.  Here the
function body has its own `a`:

```python
a = ['hi', 'bye']
def func():
    a = 2

func()
print(a)
```

### Accessing a global variable

This is bad practice, do not do this.  We will take off points.  We show you in
case you run into it.

```python
total = 0
def summation(a,b):
    global total
    for n in range(a, b+1):
        total += n

a = summation(1,100)
print("total:",total)
```

## Functions must be defined before they are used

Functions must be defined before they are used!  See the file `order1.py`:

```python
def before():
    print("I am function defined before use.")

before()
after()

def after():
    print("I am function defined after use.")
```

Output:

```
$ python3 order1.py
I am function defined before use.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "order.py", line 5, in <module>
    after()
NameError: name 'after' is not defined
$
```

A function may refer to another function defined later in the file.  The rule is
that functions must be defined before they are actually invoked/called.

See `order2.py`:

```python
def sumofsquares(a, b):
    total = 0
    for n in range(a, b+1):
        total += squared(n)
    return total

def squared(n):
    return n*n

print(sumofsquares(1,10))
```

Output:

```
$ python3 order2.py
385
```

## Passing convention

Python uses pass by object reference.  Python functions can change mutable
objects referred to by input variables

```python
def do_chores(a):
    a.pop()

b = ['feed dog', 'wash dishes']
do_chores(b)
print(b)
```

`int`s, `float`s, and `str`ings are immutable objects and cannot be changed by a
function:

```python
def increment(a):
    a = a + 1

b = 2
increment(b)
b
```

### Pass by object reference

* Python uses what is sometimes called pass by object reference when calling
  functions

* If the reference is to a mutable object (e.g. lists, dictionaries, etc.), that
  object might be modified upon return from the function

* For references to immutable objects (e.g. numbers, strings), by definition the
  original object being referenced cannot be modified

## Default and keyword arguments

We have seen that the behavior of some Python functions can be modified by
passing keyword arguments.  Keyword arguments have default values.  For example,
the `print` function has optional `end` and `sep` arguments:

```python
print("first line, ")
print("second line")
```

```python
print("first line, ", end="")
print("second line")
```

```python
print(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
print(1,2,3,4,5,6,7, sep=", ")
```

It is simple to use this feature when defining functions:

```python
def func(x, a = 1):
    return x + a

print("   func(1) =", func(1))
print("func(1, 2) =", func(1, 2))
```

The default value is used if the argument is not specified when the function is
called.

### Multiple default arguments

Consider the function prototype: `func(x, a=1, b=2)`.

Suppose we want to use the default value for `a`, but change `b`:

```python
def func(x, a=1, b=3):
    return x + a - b

print("     func(2) =", func(2))
print("  func(5, 2) =", func(5, 2))
print("func(3, b=0) =", func(3, b=0))
```

Keyword arguments may be passed in any order:

```python
func(10, b=5, a=7)
```

See the [Python Tutorial section on defining functions][py-func-tut] for more
info.

## Docstring

It is important that others, including *you-in-3-months-time* are able
to understand what your code does.

This can be easily done using a so called "docstring", as follows:

```python
def nothing():
    """ This function doesnâ€™t do anything. """
    pass
```

We can then read the docstring from the interpreter using:

```python
help(nothing)
```

Built-in Python functions also have documentation, see `help(print)`:

```python
help(print)
```

## Functions as objects

In Python everything is an object, this includes functions.  It is possible to
pass functions to other functions:

```python
def simple_function():
    print("hello from simple_function()")

def function_caller(f):
    # just call the function f
    f()
```

Now, we can pass `simple_function` to `function_caller`:

```python
function_caller(simple_function)
```

This is useful when combined with Python's [`map`][py-map] and
[`filter`][py-filter] functions.

[py-map]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map
[py-filter]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter

### `map`

The `map` function takes a mapping function and one or more iterable
objects as input arguments. The `map` returns an
[iterator](py-iter)
that applies the input function to every item of the iterable object yielding the
results. Take for example square function

```python
def square(x):
    return x*x
```

and a list as `map` inputs:

```python
map(square, [1,2,3,4,5,6])
```

The return value is an iterator can be used in a `for` loop:

```python
for s in map(square, [1,2,3,4,5,6]):
    print(s,end=', ')
print()
```

The iterator does not create a new list, it simply allows you to calculate all
mapped values. If we want to create a list with mapped values, we
pass the iterator as the input argument of the list constructor:

```python
list(map(square,[1,2,3,4,5,6]))
```


[py-iter]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9884132/what-exactly-are-iterator-iterable-and-iteration

### `filter`

The `filter` function returns an iterator over items in a container for which
the input function returns `True`:

```python
def isodd(x):
    return x % 2 != 0
```

```python
list(filter(isodd,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]))
```

Note: In Python 2.x, `map` and `filter` functions return containers with mapped
and filtered data, respecively. In Python 3.x, it is programmers responsibility
to decide when and if mapped/filtered data should be stored in memory.


### Lambda functions

A **lambda** function is simply a function without a name.  These are also
called **anonymous** functions.

They are used as an alternative way to define short functions:

```python
cube = lambda x: x*x*x
print("cube(3) = ", cube(3))
```

```python
list(map(lambda x: x*x*x, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]))
```

## Example of a bad function

```python
def add(a, b):
    # I wrote this function because Nick
    # is mean and is making us write three functions in a homework
    return a + b
```
